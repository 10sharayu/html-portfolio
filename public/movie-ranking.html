<h3>Dhoom Dhaam</h3>
<p>This was a great watch! It was a family friendly light comedy with a new kind of concept which I really liked!</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Yes, I was late to watch this one but nothing is going to top this movie this year!</p>

<h3>CTRL</h3>
<p>
    This turned out to be a surprise! Did not have much expectations from this one but it was a really great movie!
